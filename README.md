# spindle_detection
Final Project for Applied Case Studies of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Key Areas II on spindle detection.
This repository contains the code and findings for our final project for the course 'Applied Case Studies of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Key Areas II', focused on sleep spindle detection.

Sleep spindles are short bursts of brain activity detected in EEG data during sleep, and their accurate detection can contribute to the diagnosis and study of various neurological disorders. Our project aims to implement and compare several machine learning models for this task, building upon the existing literature in the field.

Data from the DREAMS dataset needs to be present at root level in the data folder.

Folders results, report, models need to be initialized to store data.

The processing order is as follows:

- patient_feature_extraction.py
- yasa_labeling.py
- label_analysis.py

The various models can then be tested in their respective folders.
