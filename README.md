Final Project for Applied Case Studies of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Key Areas II on spindle detection.
This repository contains the code and findings for our final project for the course 'Applied Case Studies of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Key Areas II', focused on sleep spindle detection.

Sleep spindles are short bursts of brain activity detected in EEG data during sleep, and their accurate detection can contribute to the diagnosis and study of various neurological disorders. Our project aims to implement and compare several machine learning models for this task, building upon the existing literature in the field.
